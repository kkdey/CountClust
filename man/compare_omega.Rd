\description{
This function computes a re-ordering of the clusters
from GoM model fit in one model to make it comparable with that
from another. The two models are applied on the same set of
samples with same number of clusters, but the features may change
from one model to another.  The two models may not be of same type
as well. One could be a DAPC model, the other a standard topic
model. Aids in checking for consistency in topic proportion
patterns across multiple GoM methods or across different types of
feature sets.
