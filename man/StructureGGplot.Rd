\arguments{
\item{omega}{Cluster membership probabilities of each
sample. Usually a sample by cluster matrix in the Topic model
output. The cluster weights sum to 1 for each sample.}

\item{annotation}{data.frame of two columns: sample_id and
  tissue_label. sample_id is a vetor consisting of character type of
  variable, which indicates the unique identifying number of each
sample. tissue_label is a vector consisting of factor type of
variable, which indicates the sample phenotype that is to be used
in sorting and grouping the samples in the Structre plot; for
example, tissue of origin in making Structure plot of the GTEx
samples. Default is set to "none for when no phenotype information
is used to order the sample vectors.}

\item{palette}{Colors assigned to label the clusters. The first
color in the palette is assigned to the cluster that is labeled 1
(usually arbitrarily assigned during the clustering process). Note:
The number of colors must be the same or greater than the number of
clusters. When the number of clusters is greater than the number of
colors, the clusters that are not assigned a color are filled with
white in the figure. The recommended choice of color palette is
RColorBrewer, for instance RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Accent") or
RColorBrewwer::brewer.pal(9, "Set1").}

\item{figure_title}{Title of the plot.}

\item{yaxis_label}{Axis label for the phenotype used to order the samples,
for example, tissue type or cell type.}

\item{order_sample}{Whether to order the samples that are of the same tissue label
or phenotype lable, that is, having the same label in the
tissue_label variable. If TRUE, we order samples that are of
the same phenotype label and sort the samples by membership
of most representative cluster. If FALSE, we keep
the order in the data.}

\item{sample_order_decreasing}{If order_sample=TRUE, then order the sample in
descending (TRUE) or ascending order.}

\item{sample_order_opts}{Orders by different choices of clusters in a batch.
Can take the values 1, 2, 3 or 4 corresponding
to 4 ordering options. Default equal to 1.}

\item{split_line}{Control parameters for the line that separates phenotype
subgroups in the plot.}

\item{plot_labels}{If TRUE, the plot the axis labels.}

\item{axis_tick}{Control parameters for x-axis and y-axis tick sizes.}

\item{legend_title_size}{The size of the title of the Structure Plot
representation.}

\item{legend_key_size}{The size of the legend key in Structure plot.}

\item{legend_text_size}{the size specification of the legend text.}
